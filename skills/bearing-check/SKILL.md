description: "The Bearing Check: an eight-checkpoint decision framework for validating strategies, investments, career moves, and life choices before committing resources. Use when analyzing 'should I do X' questions, evaluating success stories or advice, vetting business strategies, assessing opportunities with uncertainty, or when the user wants to avoid survivorship bias and think probabilistically. Triggers on phrases like 'should I', 'is this a good idea', 'evaluate this strategy', 'what are the risks', 'copy this approach', 'run a bearing check', or requests to pressure-test a decision."

# The Bearing Check

A systematic framework for validating decisions under uncertainty. Before you commit to a heading, verify your position against multiple reference points.

Prevents common reasoning errors: survivorship bias, confirmation bias, overfitting, and ignoring constraints.

## Core Principle

Most people use this pipeline: Observe outcome -> find a story -> copy the "cause" -> go all-in -> pray.

The Bearing Check uses: Observe outcomes -> rebuild the full dataset -> test alternative explanations -> model uncertainty -> personalize constraints -> act in stages -> stress-test failure -> update.

## When to Apply This Framework

**Full framework (all 8 checkpoints):** Major decisions with significant downside - career pivots, large investments, business bets, partnership commitments.

**Quick pass (checkpoints 1, 5, 7):** Smaller decisions where ground truth, odds assessment, and staged advance provide sufficient rigor.

**Single checkpoint:** When user asks about a specific aspect (e.g., "what's the base rate?" triggers Checkpoint 1 only).

## The Eight Checkpoints

Run decisions through these checkpoints sequentially. Stop and flag if a checkpoint reveals fatal flaws.

### Checkpoint 1: Ground Truth

Before stories, ask: "How often does this succeed for people like [user's situation]?"

Action: Search for population-level success rates. Cite the source and its date; never state a base rate from memory. Kills fantasies early.

### Checkpoint 2: Graveyard Recon

If you only study winners, you're studying propaganda.

Action: Actively search for people who tried the same thing and failed. What differentiated them?

### Checkpoint 3: Mechanism Check

Behavior is not mechanism. Copying the wake-up time copies the surface, not the engine.

Action: Ask what underlying forces could explain the outcome. Consider multiple hypotheses. A good explanation must survive contact with alternative explanations.

### Checkpoint 4: Fixed Points

Look for variables that remain useful across time and contexts: distribution, trust, skill depth, feedback speed, iteration count, network quality, risk control.

Action: Identify which success factors are stable vs. situational.

### Checkpoint 5: Odds Assessment

Replace "this works" with: "this increases odds," "this works under these conditions," "this fails in these scenarios."

Action: Estimate probability ranges. Ask "what are the odds, and what happens if I'm wrong?"

### Checkpoint 6: Constraint Fit

Ask: Do I have the prerequisites and the emotional bandwidth?

Factors to check: time horizon, emotional temperament, capital size, access to information, lifestyle constraints, risk tolerance, opportunity cost.

Action: If constraints don't match, adapt the strategy. Don't cosplay it.

### Checkpoint 7: Staged Advance

Start with small bets. Raise bets only when evidence is consistent.

Approach: start small -> test -> gather feedback -> increase exposure when evidence accumulates -> keep a margin of safety.

The goal isn't to be right once. The goal is to avoid ruin while compounding learning.

### Checkpoint 8: Pre-Mortem

Before you act, imagine you fail. Ask:
- What exactly caused failure?
- Can you survive that failure?
- Would you still keep executing the plan after a win or a loss?
- Is the strategy repeatable, or is it a one-time gamble?

If you can't repeat it, it's not a strategy.

## Output Format

When running a decision through this framework, structure the analysis:

```
## Decision: [What's being evaluated]

### Checkpoint 1: Ground Truth
[Population success rate for this type of decision]

### Checkpoint 2: Graveyard Recon
[What failures look like, who failed doing this]

### Checkpoint 3: Mechanism Check
[Underlying forces, alternative explanations]

### Checkpoint 4: Fixed Points
[Which success factors are durable]

### Checkpoint 5: Odds Assessment
[Odds ranges, downside scenarios]

### Checkpoint 6: Constraint Fit
[Constraint match/mismatch]

### Checkpoint 7: Staged Advance
[How to test before committing fully]

### Checkpoint 8: Pre-Mortem
[Failure modes, survivability, repeatability]

### Final Bearing
[Clear guidance with confidence level]
```
